# OfflineCRUDDemo

Demo on how to use Sync in an enviroment where some items would be created locally to be uploaded later to the backend. This items won't get overwritten by the backend and also changes to remote items won't be overwritten also.

It also displays how to deal with offline changes and deletions.

All your tasks have a localID and a remoteID, the remoteID is the ID in the backend. Since you can create tasks without internet connection and you'll need a primary key for this tasks (to update them, deleted them and so on), then we'll have another localID.

When you call Sync you'll use the next predicate to tell Sync to only insert, update and delete tasks which remoteID is different than `nil`.

```swift
let predicate = NSPredicate(format: "remoteID != %@", NSNull())
let sync = Sync(changes: remoteJSON, inEntityNamed: "Task", predicate: predicate, dataStack: self.dataStack)
sync.delegate = self
sync.start()
```

This wil cause all the local-only tasks to be skipped. Also we'll use the `SyncDelegate` to make sure that every inserted remote task has also a localID. We do this so it's easy to query all the tasks with a common primary key.

```swift
extension Fetcher: SyncDelegate {
    func sync(_ sync: Sync, willInsert json: [String: Any], in entityNamed: String, parent: NSManagedObject?) -> [String: Any] {
        var newJSON = json
        newJSON["localID"] = UUID().uuidString

        return newJSON
    }
}
```
